# Replacing built in CRUD mutations

We don't currently support a 1-to-1 replacement for the built in CRUD
replacements, but we have a fairly close approximation. This repo shows you
how - have a look at `data/before.graphql` for the GraphQL with autogenerated
CRUD mutations, and `data/after.graphql` for the GraphQL with our
replacements applied. To see the replacements themselves, look in
`db/after.sql`.

Main differences:

- You currently cannot generate `nodeId` mutations/queries from PostgreSQL functions (so `updateMyTable` no longer exists, you have to use `updateMyTableById`)
- Comments differ
- The delete mutation doesn't gain `deletedMyTableId: ID`
- The update/delete payload types have slightly different names

Alternatives:

1. You could keep the current mutation and simply wrap/replace the resolver with `makeWrapResolversPlugin` (introduced in PostGraphile v4.1) [Quick and easy]
2. You could reimplement the mutation yourself in perfect fidelity [using `makeExtendSchemaPlugin`](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/make-extend-schema-plugin/) [Easy-ish, better customisability, but not as quick]
3. You can apply any modifications you like using our powerful plugin system [Involves learning the plugin system, which doesn't have exceptionally good documentation right now]
